	The Denver Code Club is starting a weekly jquery meetup soon to go through the book <%= link_to "jQuery Hotshot", "http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-hotshot/book", target: 'blank' %>.

	My goal for the next 8 weeks is to be one step ahead of the class in reading and understanding the material so I can be a resource for the rest of the students. Also, the more I know about the material the more in-depth questions I can ask of my more experienced peers there. It's definitely a win-win. I'll post the result of the projects on this site so that anyone can see my progress in mastering jQuery.
